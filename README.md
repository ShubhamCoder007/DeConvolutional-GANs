# DeConvolutional-GANs
This network model is designed and trained to generate my unprecedented image of my face.

The Generator generates my facial features and learns it from the discriminator which have been trained directly from it 
and hence it gives feedback to the generator about the validity of the image which is being generated and considering that
the Generator generates accordingly.

The data is contained within the data/data/85 directory which are the real images.
The generated images are stored after the end of every epochs. An improving trend of better generations of the images
could be observed over the epochs.
